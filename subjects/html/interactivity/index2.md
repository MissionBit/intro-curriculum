# Project Choose Your Own Adventure (cont)

Using anchor tags, build a choose your own adventure story.

Here's an example:

> We continued with this project for the whole class. The
> students that finished their project spent time polishing it.
> We still have some students that want to spend more time on
> this so we'll have some more time with it on Thursday, but
> I think I'll want to cut it off at the half.

# Project Animation

If students finish the choose your own adventure quickly, give them
this animation project to play with.

> We spent the whole time on the choose your own adventure project.
> I'll integrate this with the first JavaScript lesson in day 6.

# Group Project Planning

At the half, organize the students by interest to pitch a project
idea. The project should go a bit beyond what we've learned so far,
but not too much. The maximum sort of complexity that would make sense
would be something equivalent to Flappy Bird, or a site with a handful
of separate pages. We'll tailor the lessons to cover techniques that
will be necessary to complete the projects.

Rough project ideas should be pitched by the end of class.

> I think this will get pushed back even further to day 7.
