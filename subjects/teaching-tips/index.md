Here are some guiding principles for how we like to think about teaching and learning. They’re not meant to be definitive or comprehensive by any means, just useful little nuggets to orient you. Ultimately, every student has different needs, and you should take those needs into account.

<h3 id="our-mission"><a href="#our-mission">THE GOAL IS NOT TO CREATE PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMERS.</a></h3>

Teaching with that assumption can alienate students who don’t think of themselves as becoming developers someday (which is a lot of people!). As much as we can, we don’t want to limit the type of people that code. Instead, we want to create a welcoming environment where students can start to get a feel for programming and choose to continue learning it if they like.

If a student’s goal is to be a developer someday, great! Encourage them!

A useful way of thinking about it is to empower students, help them feel like they are in control of the technology that increasingly surrounds them. If they like programming,  and have the resources, motivation, and encouragement to do so, then maybe they’ll continue learning it. If not, then hopefully they had fun, feel more comfortable with technology, and have something cool to show for their experience.

<h3 id="time-to-first-awesome"><a href="#time-to-first-awesome">Lower the “time to first awesome” as much as possible.</a></h3>

The faster you can get something cool happening, the better. No one likes jumping through a million hoops they don’t understand in order to get something done, especially when they’re just starting out.

Harvard’s popular CS50 “Intro to Computer Science” class found a much lower dropout rate when introducing programming using Scratch, a programming environment for children that takes almost no work to make something interesting happening.


<h3 id="motivation-is-key"><a href="#motivation-is-key">The most effective learning experience you can have is working hard on something you care about.</a></h3>

I think we’ve probably all had the experience of neglecting sleep, friends, and responsibilities in order to finish a program. Not that we want this to happen, just that intrinsic motivation is the fundamental force behind learning. Foster it in your students!

Try to tap into students’ interests (but don’t be lame about it). Programming can be used in a huge variety of contexts, so help students find interesting, approachable projects. If someone is personally motivated to do something they deem worthy, then learning will be so much more fun and effective.

Most students are accustomed to the typical, passive classroom experience of being told what to do. See if you can nudge them out of that mindset. As much as possible, we want the student to be in control of their learning experiences, with us as resources rather than authorities.

<h3 id="let-students-figure-things-out"><a href="#let-students-figure-things-out">Try to let people figure things out for themselves.</a></h3>

Pretty often you’ll see someone doing something that isn’t going to work. Resist the impulse to step in and correct them unless they ask for help. Mistakes are great first-hand experiences for guiding a learner to a better understanding of how programming works. Note that this is very different from typical school experiences where mistakes are shameful and ridiculed.

If you really feel it would be better to step in, be polite. e.g. "Can I show you something?"

<h3 id="get-to-where-they-are"><a href="#get-to-where-they-are">To rescue someone, you have to get to where they are.</a></h3>

Students don’t have the mental models for programming that you’ve developed over the years. As much as possible, try to understand their thinking process to help guide them to a better understanding.

Remember, people usually make pretty reasonable guesses of how things work, even if they’re wrong. Don’t dismiss what they’ve learned, but recognize and mold it.

<h3 id="peers-as-teachers"><a href="#peers-as-teachers">Peers can be really good teachers!</a></h3>

They’re going through the same learning process and can often understand how someone is thinking well enough to get them over hurdles.

Students that “get it” quicker may be able to help others.

Letting the students work in groups seems helpful. They can ask and answer their own questions and look at each other’s screens when they’re stuck.

<h3 id="careful-with-jargon"><a href="#careful-with-jargon">Be careful with jargon.</a></h3>

We take a lot of our jargon for granted. Function, variable, library, for loop, class, attribute, method, tag, bracket. We use these and many other terms in strange ways for beginners. Especially at the start of a semester, it might be worth trying to speak in plain language about these concepts. After gently introducing terms and using them for a while, students will start making the connection between concepts and vocabulary.

<h3 id="show-and-tell"><a href="#show-and-tell">Show and tell. Depict and describe.</a></h3>

Try to not only tell students about how a concept works but show them, in excruciating detail if needed. The less a learner has to imagine, the better. People can understand what they can see! For example, when creating an animation it is not at all obvious that the smooth motion of objects on the screen is the result of successively rendered static frames. Slowing the frame rate down to a crawl so students can see each frame rendered and slowly speeding it up illustrates the concept better than any number of words. Even better would be to let the students control the frame rate themselves.

<h3 id="not-too-prescriptive"><a href="#not-too-prescriptive">Try not to be too prescriptive.</a></h3>

While you may have learned the “right” way to do something from hard-won experience, the students haven’t yet! They need to discover for themselves (with your guidance) why certain methods are better than others. You might suggest alternative ways of doing something, but don’t get so stuck on the one “right” way of doing something.

Not: “These lines of codes should be made into a function.” Better: “Making these lines of code into a function might make it easier for you to understand your program.”

<h3 id="infinite-patience"><a href="#infinite-patience">Be flexible. Have infinite patience.</a></h3>

If the students are taking you in a certain direction, don’t be afraid to go there. Don’t stick blindly to curricula if you’re students aren’t into it or have something better to do.

You are a Zen master. Learning can be a slooow process and everyone has a different pace.

Students will have many different backgrounds and learning styles. Respect them all!

If you or a student is bored or discouraged or frustrated, recognize that and try to change the situation. You are both human and sometimes it happens.

<h3 id="take-pictures"><a href="#take-pictures">Take pictures and videos!</a></h3>

It’s fun and can help future instructors and students!

    <p>This is the Bible of learning to program and programming to learn. It describes how people learn and how programming can facilitate the process.</p>

    <blockquote>For me, getting to know a domain of knowledge is much like coming into a new community of people. Sometimes one is initially overwhelmed by a bewildering array of undifferentiated faces. Only gradually do the individuals begin to stand out. [&hellip;] Similarly, when one enters a new domain of knowledge, one initially encounters a crowd of new ideas. Good learners are able to pick out those who are powerful and congenial. Others who are less skillful need help from teachers and friends. But we must not forget that while good teachers play the role of mutual friends who can provide introductions, the actual job of getting to know an idea or a person cannot be done by a third party.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Good tutors ask questions. They don’t tell the student what to do. The [tutoring] researchers counted what percentage of the remarks their best tutors made were questions, as opposed to statements or instructions. Eighty to ninety percent. This number is insane! Ninety percent questions! You can’t talk like that. Nobody talks like that. Except the very best tutors.</blockquote>

    <p>An invaluable book for understanding how children think in schools and why they think that way. Crucial for empathizing with your students.</p>

    <blockquote>Kids have trouble with arithmetic, not only because they have to memorize a host of facts that seem to have no pattern, meaning, or interest, but also because they are given a host of rules for manipulating these facts, which they have to take on faith.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>A child who has really learned something can use it, and does use it. It is connected with reality in his mind, there he can make other connections between it and reality when the chance comes. A piece of unreal learning has no hooks on it; it can’t be attached to anything, it is of no use to the learner.</blockquote>

    <p>How to design a programming system for understanding programs. If nothing else, this essay does a great job showing some of the biggest stumbling blocks in programming today.</p>

    <blockquote>Think about this. We expect programmers to write code that manipulates variables, without ever seeing the values of those variables. We expect readers to understand code that manipulates variables, without ever seeing the values of the variables. The entire purpose of code is to manipulate data, and we never see the data. We write with blindfolds, and we read by playing pretend with data-phantoms in our imaginations.</blockquote>

    <p>Recognizing the value of playful exploration and tinkering in learning and how learning environments can be designed to encourage that style. Shows how tinkering is an often-used, but rarely encouraged technique when learning.</p>

    <blockquote>There are many different approaches to making things, and some lead to richer learning experiences than others. In this chapter, we focus on a particular approach to making that we describe as tinkering. The tinkering approach is characterized by a playful, experimental, iterative style of engagement, in which makers are continually reassessing their goals, exploring new paths, and imagining new possibilities. Tinkering is undervalued (and even discouraged) in many educational settings today, but it is well aligned with the goals and spirit of the progressive-constructionist tradition—and, in our view, it is exactly what is needed to help young people prepare for life in today’s society.</blockquote>
